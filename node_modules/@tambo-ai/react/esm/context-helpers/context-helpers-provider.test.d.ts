/**
 * Tests for the Context Helpers API.
 *
 * The new API treats a context helper as a plain function that returns a value
 * to include in context, or null/undefined to skip. The provider wraps each
 * value with its key name as { name, context } before sending with messages.
 *
 * This test suite validates that:
 *  - Helper functions can return sync/async values.
 *  - Returning null/undefined causes the helper to be skipped.
 *  - Errors in helpers are caught and skipped.
 *  - The provider aggregates helpers passed in its props and returns AdditionalContext[].
